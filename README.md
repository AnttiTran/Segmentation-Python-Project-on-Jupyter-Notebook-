Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering (Python, Jupyter)
This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, and unsupervised learning using the scikit-learn library. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters based on behavioral or demographic features to support targeted marketing strategies.

Tools & Libraries:

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler)

Key Steps:

Data cleaning and preparation

Feature selection and scaling

Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters

K-Means model implementation and evaluation

Visualizing cluster results
